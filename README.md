You should also display the data in an easy-to-use and understandable format (e.g. statistical data, etc.) and let the user interact with the data you provided Along with this Github link to this app you make, a small demo of a 2 min video showing us how to use the app is also submitted;
The rapid API used for this project is here in here https://rapidapi.com/principalapis/api/currency-conversion-and-exchange-rates/playground/apiendpoint_cba2fdf5-4719-4883-ab4d-b32f6c45e48f.
