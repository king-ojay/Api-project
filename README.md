This project is in response to an assignment which the requrement is as follows;

Developing and designing a small application of any kind that incorporates the use of APIs.
It is focus to test students ability to use external APIs to fetch and display relevant data in your app.
The external APIs in developing the web application as suggested by the project prompt is: https://rapidapi.com/categories. Other prompt of the project is as follows. Or any sources you prefer (Careful to vet the public APIs you use as some might be malicious) You will focus on using external APIs (e.g. APIs for travel, entertainment, etc.) and extending the functionality of your application by making use of a public API of your choice The application you come up with should be useful and not just for entertainment.

You should also display the data in an easy-to-use and understand format (e.g. statistical data, etc.) and let the user interact with the data you provided (e.g. sort, etc.) Along with this Github link to this app you make, a small demo of a 2 min video showing us how to use the app is also submitted;
The rapid API used for this project is here in the .

HOW TO USE

After launching the app, users are prompted to select their desired currencies to check rates from a list in the drop-down menu and click the rate button.
The button displays the current market rate of the currencies in the panel.
If the desired currency is not in the drop-down, users are prompted to click the enter currency code button, which takes them to a panel where they can input their own currency code and click the rate button in the panel also to get the prevailing market rate at the time.
